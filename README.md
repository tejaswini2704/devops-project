##  Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **main** | Stable, production-ready code |
| **dev** | Integration and testing branch |
| **feature/** | Feature-specific branches (e.g., `feature`) |

Example commands:
```bash
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev

git checkout -b feature
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature script"
git push -u origin feature
